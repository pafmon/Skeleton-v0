# Squeleton — bones

Interactive 3D anatomy tool for learning muscle attachments. Built with Three.js + Svelte + Vite.

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Workflow

### 1. Define muscles (editor)

Press **E** to toggle edit mode. In the right sidebar:

1. Enter muscle name + origin zone name + insertion zone name → **Add Muscle**  
   Zones are created automatically if they don't exist yet.
2. Select a zone from the list.
3. Click/drag on the bone to paint its faces.
4. Repeat for all zones.
5. **Save** — writes `data/areas.json` and `data/muscles.json` to disk.

### 2. Quiz mode

Quiz activates automatically once both data files exist and have content. Click two zones on the bone to identify the muscle's origin and insertion.

## Important

**Finalise `arm.glb` before painting.** Zone data is stored as triangle face indices of the mesh. If the model changes after painting, all zones need to be repainted.

## Build for deployment

```bash
npm run build   # outputs to dist/
```

Deploy `dist/` to any static host. The quiz works fully on a static host. The `/save` write endpoint only works in dev mode — commit `data/` after editing.
